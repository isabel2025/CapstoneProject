# Air Quality Forecasting & Alert System

This repository contains the capstone project by **Isabel Prempeh** and **Kofi Adu-Labi**, focused on building a data-driven air quality forecasting and alert system. The project includes a machine learning model to predict AQI (Air Quality Index) values, a user-friendly mobile app to alert users about air quality conditions, and a supporting dataset and presentation.


## ðŸš€ Features

- **Machine Learning Model:** Predicts AQI levels using historical data.
- **Mobile Application:** Android-based app built for real-time air quality alerts.
- **Dataset:** Clean and well-structured CSV dataset of AQI data.
- **End-to-End Pipeline:** From data ingestion and preprocessing to model training, evaluation, and deployment.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook
- Android Studio / Java (for the mobile app)
- PowerPoint (for presentation)
- Video editing tools for demo

## ðŸ“Š Dataset

The `aqi_dataset.csv` contains historical air quality data used for training and testing the forecasting model.

## ðŸ“± Android App

The app (`app-release.apk`) allows users to receive air quality warnings and view forecasts. It's designed to be lightweight and user-friendly.

## ðŸŽ¥ Demo

Watch the [Demo.mp4](./Demo/Demo.mp4) for a walk-through of the app and model performance.

## ðŸ“„ Report & Presentation

## ðŸ§ª How to Run the Model

1. Open `CapstoneCode.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
2. Install dependencies:  
   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib
